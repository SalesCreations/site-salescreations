          I remember when I was a child, my mother let me take the family photography camera to take pictures of my first two
          trips together with school. It was a basic photographic film camera and I remember her buying the films with 24 poses
          ðŸ˜‚. I didn't have the digital 'preview' and I only knew how the photo turned out when it was developed. When I started
          my graduation, I had the photography subject teaching the basics and its aspects and in recent years, my passion for
          registering moments has only increased.
